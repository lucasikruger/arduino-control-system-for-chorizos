# CHORIZOMETRO CONTROLLER V1.

This is a personal project to create a humedity and temperature controller for argentinian chorizo preparation.

# Werhe to run the project

The project was thought to be used in a arduino UNO.
The electronic components used were:

- Shield de Keypad + Pantalla LCD 16x2
- DHT 22
- 4 Relays module

# MAIN FUNCTIONs

It will control the temperature and the humedity via two values.
The value and the variation.
If the meassured value is less than value-var, one relay will be put on to do some action in real world to increment the value.
So we will use cold/hit to control temperature.
And air/hum to control humidity.
